This is how I ran 5.filestomatrix.R
R CMD BATCH --vanilla "--args ANGO 22170" 5.filestomatrix.R

This is how I ran 6.thresholdmat.R
R CMD BATCH --vanilla "--args ANGO" 6.thresholdmat.R

R CMD BATCH --vanilla "--args ANGO" 7.blondel_convert.R


I copy 8.blondel.R to the directory and run it there. This is because I want the *.Rout. 
The *.Rout file shows the increase in modularity through the different levels. 
R CMD BATCH --vanilla "--args ANGO 2" 8.blondel.R

I copy 9.hierarchy.R to the directory and run it there. This is because I have to input
the number of levels manually after reading it from '8.blondel.R'. The old bct functions used to
output the levels, but the new bct doesn't do that. 
R CMD BATCH --vanilla "--args ANGO 2 3" 9.hierarchy.R
